title: About me
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [IBM Research Europe](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/). My current research mainly centers around foundational models for weather and geospatial in collaboration with [NASA](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov).

Before joining IBM as a postdoc, I was a PhD student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), focusing on applied deep learning, mainly in the context of data-centric AI. My thesis is entitled "Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence: Foundations and Methods for Deep Learning" and aims for providing scalable methods to systematically enhance data for deep learning. During my undergrad studies at KIT, I specialiyed in machine learning, statistics, and optimization and with a graduated bachelor’s and a master’s degree. During my master’s degree, I studied Information Systems and Computer Engineering at the [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal and authored my master's thesis at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) at the Chair of Management Information Systems in the field of machine learning and optimization. 

Throughout my studies, I have worked on real-world machine learning implementations (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) during internships at [Porsche motorsports](https://motorsports.porsche.com/usa/en), [d-fine](https://www.d-fine.com/en/), and [EnBW](https://www.enbw.com/company/). For the first year of my Ph.D., I worked as an Affiliated Research Member at ETH Zurich to research emotion dynamics on social media. 

In October 2022, I joined IBM Research as a Visiting Researcher and since then have been working on geospatial and weather foundation models as well as unsupervised domain adaptation. I am part of a research collaboration between [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) and [NASA](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov), where I am mainly working on pretraining, scaling, and finetuning [geospatial foundation models](https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-nasa-foundation-models) and [weather foundation models](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/weather-ai-fm-workshop).

During the weekends, I love spending time in the mountains with my wife, my family, and my friends.
