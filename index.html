<h3>
    Hi there, I'm Johannes!
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    I am a Postdoc within the AI for Climate Impact team at <a href="https://www.zurich.ibm.com">IBM Research Europe</a>. My work at IBM Research focuses on pretraining and finetuning foundations models for weather and geospatial in collaboration with <a href="https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov">NASA</a>. I have a background in applied deep learning, having worked on a variety of topics during my PhD at <a href="https://dsi.iism.kit.edu/team_jakubik.php">KIT</a>, my visiting research role at IBM Research, at <a href="https://mtec.ethz.ch">ETH Zurich</a>, and during several internships in industry.
