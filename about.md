### Hi there, I'm Johannes!

I am a Research Scientist within the AI for Climate Impact team at IBM Research Europe. In my role, I am leading projects on multimodal generative modeling and am co-leading IBM Research's activities on deep learning for planetary observations. I especially focus on pretraining and scaling multi-modal deep learning models in collaborations with NASA, ESA, and within the EU Horizon program. In addition, I'm co-leading work at the intersection of deep learning and quantum graph optimization. 

My work on deep learning for planetary observations and weather modeling has been awarded with the NASA Agency Group Award, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Honor Award, several IBM accomplishment awards, and was featured in international and national media. As part of my work, I am fortunate enough to co-supervise several exceptionally bright Ph.D. students at ETH Zurich and Trinity College.

I graduated from KIT and ETH, where my research spanned across all relevant subfields of deep learning-based systems: data-centricity, model-centricity, and human-centricity. My thesis on data-centric AI has been awarded with summa cum laude and a national-level dissertation award by the VDE -- one of the largest technology organizations in Europe. I also received a best paper award, and a best paper award nomination for theoretical contributions to human-centric AI. In fall 2024, I was fortunate enough to be recommended as a top candidate for a tenure track professorship at a German university of excellence. Together with a range of amazing co-authors, my work has been published in highly recognized journals and conferences.

On weekends, you will find me somewhere in the mountains with my wife, our son, and our dog!
