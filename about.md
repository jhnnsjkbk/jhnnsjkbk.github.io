title: About me
---

I am a Postdoc within the AI for Climate Impact team at <a href="https://www.zurich.ibm.com">IBM Research Europe</a>. My work at IBM Research focuses on pretraining and scaling foundations models for weather in collaboration with <a href="https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov">NASA</a> as well as developing multi-modal geospatial foundation models in an ESA-funded project. I have a background in applied deep learning, having worked on a variety of topics during my PhD at <a href="https://dsi.iism.kit.edu/team_jakubik.php">KIT</a>, my visiting research role at IBM Research, at <a href="https://mtec.ethz.ch">ETH Zurich</a>, and during several internships in industry. 

As a core contributor to a family of geospatial models called Prithvi, I actively engage with NASA, ESA, and participate in EU HORIZON projects. Together with researchers from MIT, Oxford, and ETH Zurich, I actively work towards integrating earth observation and weather data. My research has been published in top journals and presented at leading conferences, including NeurIPS, AAAI, and IJCAI.

Before joining IBM as a postdoc, I served a PhD student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), focusing on applied deep learning, mainly in the context of data-centric AI. My thesis is entitled "Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence: Foundations and Methods for Deep Learning" and aims for providing scalable methods to systematically enhance data for deep learning. During my undergrad studies at KIT, I specialized in machine learning, statistics, and optimization and graduated with a bachelor’s and a master’s degree. During my master’s, I studied Information Systems and Computer Engineering at the [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal and authored my master's thesis at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the field of machine learning and optimization. 

Throughout my studies, I have worked on real-world machine learning implementations (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) during internships at [Porsche motorsports](https://motorsports.porsche.com/usa/en), [d-fine](https://www.d-fine.com/en/), and [EnBW](https://www.enbw.com/company/). In October 2022, I joined IBM Research as a Visiting Researcher and since then have been working on geospatial and weather foundation models as well as unsupervised domain adaptation. 

During the weekends, I love spending time in the mountains.
