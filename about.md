### Hi there, I'm Johannes!

I am a Staff Research Scientist within the AI for Climate Impact team at IBM Research Europe. In my role, I am leading research activities on pretraining and scaling multi-modal AI foundation models for earth observation as well as developing AI foundation models for weather and climate assessments in collaborations with NASA, ESA, and within the EU Horizon program. My work on large-scale deep learning for Earth observation was awarded with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Honor Award, several IBM accomplishment awards, and was featured in various international and national media. I am fortunate enough to be able to supervise and mentor several exceptionally bright Ph.D. students at MIT and ETH Zurich. 
    
I graduated from KIT and ETH, where my research spanned across all relevant subfields of deep learning-based systems: data-centricity, model-centricity, and human-centricity. During my Ph.D., I received a best paper award and a best paper award nomination for theoretical contributions to human-centric AI. In fall 2024, I was fortunate enough to be recommended as a top candidate for a tenure track professorship at a German university of excellence. Together with a range of amazing co-authors, my work has been published in highly recognized journals and conferences.

On weekends you will find me somewhere in the mountains with my wife, our son, and our dog!
