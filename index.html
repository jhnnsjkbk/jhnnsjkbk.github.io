<h3>
    Hi there, I'm Johannes!
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    I am a Research Scientist within the AI for Climate Impact team at IBM Research Europe. In my role, I am co-leading IBM Research's activities on deep learning for planetary observations with a focus on pretraining and scaling multi-modal deep learning models in collaborations with NASA, ESA, and within the EU Horizon program. Besides that, I contribute to the development of deep learning models for weather and climate assessments and quantum optimization algorithms.
    <br>
    <br>
    My work on deep learning for planetary observations and weather modeling was awarded with the NASA Agency Group Award, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Honor Award, several IBM accomplishment awards, and was featured in various international and national media. I am fortunate enough to supervise several exceptionally bright Ph.D. students at MIT and ETH Zurich.
