<h3>
    Hi there, I'm Johannes!
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    I am a Staff Research Scientist within the AI for Climate Impact team at IBM Research Europe. In my role, I am leading research activities on pretraining and scaling AI foundation models for weather and climate assessments, as well as multi-modal AI foundation models for earth observation in collaborations with NASA, ESA, and within the EU Horizon program. My work on large-scale deep learning for Earth observation was awarded with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Honor Award, several IBM accomplishment awards, and was featured in various international and national media. I am fortunate enough to be able to supervise and mentor several exceptionally bright Ph.D. students at MIT and ETH Zurich. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    I graduated from KIT and ETH, where my research spanned across all relevant subfields of deep learning-based systems: data-centricity, model-centricity, and human-centricity. During my Ph.D., I received a best paper award and a best paper award nomination for theoretical contributions to human-centric AI. In fall 2024, I was fortunate enough to be recommended as a top candidate for a tenure track professorship at a German university of excellence. Together with a range of amazing co-authors, my work has been published in highly recognized journals and conferences.
